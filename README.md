In this project, I worked with the Petal Power dataset to analyze and predict species of flowers based on their physical characteristics. By applying machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors and decision trees, I was able to classify flower species with a high degree of accuracy. This project demonstrated my ability to preprocess data, implement models, and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
